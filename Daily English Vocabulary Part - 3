    "description": "Learn to speak fluent English -- Accent Training, Correct Grammar usage, Idioms, Phrases and vocabulary with example sentences. \n\n\nDaily Video Vocabulary Episode 81 : Inhibit\nSometimes you can't do something that you are willing to due to many reasons, it could be because you are shy or embarrassed to do it or it could be something that stops or restricts you from doing it.\nThe word inhibit basically means something that  prevents oneself from doing something due to their shyness or the fear of facing embarrassment due to some restrictions applied.\n When you restrain or suppress yourself from behaving in a particular manner or from speaking something, you are holding yourself back, it means you are inhibiting yourself. This could because you are extremely shy or embarrassed.\nThe action of prohibiting or inhibiting is known as inhibition. It is a feeling that makes one self conscious and unable to behave in a relaxed and a natural manner.\nAs the word inhibits shows the action of restricting or forbidding, it is a verb.\nFor example, when you are performing on the stage for the first time, you feel very shy, you are inhibited from doing your best. It means, you find it difficult to lose your inhibitions and give it your best shot.\n\nExample 01 : Maria had no inhibitions and spoke boldly about her divorce to her friends.\nExample 02 : The high rate of interest on home loans has inhibited James and Lisa from taking a bank loan to buy a new apartment.\n\nExample 03 : After a couple of drinks, William and Peter lost all their inhibitions and started talking and laughing loudly at their friend's party.\n\nExample 04 : Catherine is on a weight loss program and finds it very difficult to inhibit herself from eating burgers.\n\nExample 05 : Lack of hospitals and health care centers in the village, inhibited the poor from getting medical facilities whenever they required it.\n\nExample 06 : Mother told little John, \" You shouldn't allow the fear of failure to inhibit you from reattempting your exams.\"\n\nExample 07 : To inhibit any further argument, Andrea threatened her son of being locked in a dark room.\n\nExample 08 : The stern voice of the teacher, inhibits all the students from approaching her when they have any queries.\n\nExample 09 : Drinking coffee in excess inhibits the absorption of iron from your diet.",

    "description": "Are you a person who lets out secrets unintentionally? A person who can't keep a secret, is someone who always lets the cat out of the bag.\nThe idiom 'to let the cat out of the bag' means to reveal a secret or a surprise by accident.\nYou give out information that you shouldn't, or reveal a surprise without intending to and you actually kill the surprise element.\nLetting the cat out of the bag may be a symptom of being a blabbermouth or having loose lips. So when you let the cat out of the bag, it means that a secret slipped out just like a cat escaping from a bag.\nFor example, if a couple is at a family dinner, the husband announces that his wife is pregnant, he let's the cat out of the bag. He reveals a surprise before time even though he didn't intend to.\nOkay, now that you know what this idiom means, let's take a look at some example sentences to see how you can use it in your daily conversation.\n\nExample 01 : Lisa was shocked when her friend let the cat out of the bag about her suspension from school.\nExample 02 : William didn't let the cat out of the bag before time; and waited to gift his wife on their birthday.\nExample 03 : Despite stopping him, Peter let the cat out of the bag about Kevin's plan of resigning.\nExample 04 : Her friends were shocked when Jessica let the cat out of the bag about her plastic surgery.\nExample 05 : Dressed as Santa Claus for his grandchild, grandfather didn't let the cat out of the bag by revealing his real identity.\nExample 06 : Though mother never let the cat out of the bag about her smoking habit, her daughter was shocked to see her smoking.\nExample 07 : Amy's friends didn't let the cat out of the bag about her surprise birthday party before the actual day.\nExample 08 : Gloria and Cathy share all their secrets and never let the cat out of the bag about each other's life.\nExample 09 : Diana lost interest in the book after her friend let the cat out of the bag about the suspense.\nWhen was the last time you let the cat out of the bag and realized that you shouldn't have?",

    "description": "When someone tells you something, you may not take it at face value as you may be doubtful about what they are saying, and you are not sure whether to believe it or not.\nThe word 'dubious' actually means someone or something is doubtful, uncertain and questionable.\n\nIf something arouses doubt, it is not trustworthy as you know it's not honest. It actually lacks conviction and you are suspicious about it. \n\nIf your mind is unsettled about doing or not doing something, it means you are dubious.\nWhen you are dubious about something, you doubt whether it is good or bad, or whether it is going to yield a positive result or not.\n\nThe word 'dubious' is an adjective as it describes someone or something of being doubtful or uncertain, 'dubiously' is an adverb. 'Dubiousness' is a noun that means doubtfulness.\n\nFor example, a company which was involved in a scandal would always have a dubious reputation. This means that people can never rely on such a company as they no longer find it trustworthy.\n\n\nExample 01 : After being fired from his job, Michael sat dubiously, wondering about getting a new job during the recession period.\n\nExample 02 :The dubiousness of the lease contract for their new house got the couple very worried.\n\nExample 03 : On being questioned by the police regarding the murder case, Marc answered so dubiously that it increased the police's suspicion.\n\nExample 04 : On being dubious about his patient's eye condition, the Opthalmologist conducted some tests to clear all the doubts.\n\nExample 05 : While taking his Science exam, Martin was very dubious about clearing it as he hadn't prepared enough for it.\n\nExam 06 : The tourist wasn't dubious while climbing the canopy bridge.\n\nExample 07 : At the meeting, the accountant tried to justify her dubious accounting practices.\n\nExample 08 : Ken had to blow the breath test as the cop was dubious about his alcohol level.\n\nExample 09 : At the bakery, the baker showed the sandwiches to the customer as he was dubious about its freshness.\n\nExample 10 : The pharmacist was dubious and reluctant to hand over the medicine without a prescription.\n\nWhat have you been dubious about, and why?\n\n\n\nVisit us at : \nhttp://www.letstalkpodcast.com\nhttp://www.learnex.in\nhttp://www.letstalk.co.in",
