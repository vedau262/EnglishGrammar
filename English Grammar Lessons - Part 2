    "description": "✅ https://youtu.be/puNo0sxC3VI\n👉 Check the latest Video -  American Idioms I love to use the most?\n\nHow to use an APOSTROPHE correctly in written English? – Free English Grammar Lessons online\n\nTake the Quiz - \nhttp://www.learnex.in/apostrophe-written-english-ielts-writing-practice\n\nIn this English lesson, Rachna will teach you how to use an apostrophe when you want to express possession in written English. Often, people get confused when they have to use an apostrophe in written English. This English lesson helps you clear your confusion.\n\nExample 1: Britain’s coastline is very beautiful. (to show something belongs to something or someone)\n\nExample 2: The girl’s bedroom is big. (the bedroom that belongs to the girl, one girl)\n                     The girls’ bedroom is big. (many girls share the same room)\nWhen the plural noun ends with an ‘s’, just put an apostrophe after the ‘s’. Do not add an ‘s’ after the apostrophe. Example: The girls’s ( incorrect).\n\nExample 3: My boss’s car is new. (the car that belongs to my boss. You can avoid adding an ‘s’ after the apostrophe)\n                     My bosses’ car is new. (My bosses have a common car)\n                     My bosses’s (incorrect)\n\nExample 4: We went to Maria’s sister’s wedding.  (two possessives in a sentence. We attended the wedding of the sister of Maria)\n\n Example 5: The door handle is lose.\n                      The kitchen table is clean. \n\nThe door’s handle and the kitchen’s table, both are incorrect. Do not use an apostrophe to show possession for objects.\n\nExample 6: The name of the ship was ‘Wonder Queen’. (not the ship’s name)\n\nExample 7: My friend’s name is Andrew. ( you can use an apostrophe as you are talking about something that belongs to a person)\n\nRemember, an apostrophe is used with a person, place, animal or an organization.",

Firstly, let me make it very simple by saying that both these words are used when you are talking about two actions that happen at the exact same time.\n\nLearn English with Let’s Talk Academy’s YouTube channel.

Do we use “while” or “when”? Now that’s a tricky question.  But I’ll make it very simple and clear for you.\nEg: He got into a fight while we were shopping.\nIn this case, you can use both “while” or “when” mainly because the single action comes before the continuous action\nBut if we change the sentence around we say\nEg: We were shopping when he got into a fight. (Single action comes after the continuous action)",

The active voice is used to give importance to the subject or the doer of the action and the passive voice gives importance to the object.\n\nFacebook : http://www.facebook.com/letstalkpodcast\nWebsite : http://www.letstalkpodcast.com\n\nThere are basic steps you follow to convert the sentences from active to passive.\n\nInterchange the subject and object\nTake the main verb in its past participle form.\nDo not change the tense of the original sentence, so add an auxiliary verb.\nEnsure the doer of the action does not change once the sentence is in the passive voice.\n\n\nExample 01: Mother writes an email. (active)\n                      An email is written by mother. (passive)\n\nExample 02: Sam is fixing the computer.

    "description": "English Grammar lesson - Transportation Prepositions\n\nTake the quiz  : http://www.learnex.in/transportation-prepositions\n\nIn this English Grammar lesson we will learn using the prepositions related to travel / transportation. English prepositions can be tricky because they usually don't have any particular rules. However,when we talk about the ways to travel there are few rules which really work for English Learners.\n\nWebsite : http://www.letstalkpodcast.com\nFacebook : http://www.facebook.com/letstalkpodcast\nYoutube : http://www.youtube.com/learnexmumbai\n\nUsing the preposition By :-\nWhen we talk about general ways to travel we always use the preposition 'by'. For example - We travel by car ,by train , by can, by bus, by plane and so on. We can also use the preposition 'by' to refer to the transportation environment or the surface for example, by air, by land, by sea, by rail.\n\nUsing the preposition In :- \n\nWhen we talk about specific transport vehicles we use the preposition 'in'. If you can sit inside the vehicle we use 'in'. For example - In a car , In a truck , in a helicopter , in a taxi, in a rowboat.\n\nUsing the preposition on :- \n\nWhen we talk about specific transport vehicles especially on which one can stand or walk on a vehicle, we use the preposition 'on'.\nFor example - We go on a plane , we go on a ferry , we go on a ship , on a Train , on a   Bicycle, on a  Motorbike , ( the basic mode of travel - on foot).\n\nAlso when we talk about sitting on animals we always use the preposition on or onto, for example -  We get on / onto a horse, camel, elephant etc. \n\nThe key thing is to understand when something is general and when something is specific . Hope this English Grammar lesson is clear to all you out there.",

    "description": "Advanced English Lesson – Using ‘Having Said That’ (Transitional Phrase) \nBlog : http://www.learnex.in/using-having-said-that-transitional-phrase\n\nThis is an intermediate English lesson. You will learn how to use the transitional phrase “Having said that” in your daily English conversation. This phrase has become more and more common in the spoken English language. When people say, “Having said that” it is a signal that they are going to say something which will contrast or disagree with what they said a moment ago. It means, ‘despite what has just been said’.\n\nWebsite : http://www.letstalkpodcast.com\nFacebook : http://www.facebook.com/letstalkpodcast\nYoutube : http://www.youtube.com/learnexmumbai\n\nIt can also be replaced with ‘That said’\n\nExample: Their work has been fairly good. Having said that, I still think there's room for improvement. (In this sentence, first you appreciate and compliment the work done. But, in the latter sentence, you say there is scope for improvement. So, you have contradicted your first sentence to some extent.)\n\nTheir work has been fairly good. That said, I still think there's room for improvement.\n\nExample: John forgets most things. Having said that, he always remembers my birthday. (first you say he’s forgetful, but you contrast by saying he remembers your birthday)\n\nJohn forgets most things. That said, he always remembers my birthday.\n\nExample: This café is expensive. Having said that, the food here is really nice.\n\nThis café is expensive. That said, the food here is really nice.",

    "description": "English Grammar lessons - When to Use an Exclamation Mark?\n\nhttp://www.learnex.in/when-to-use-an-exclamation-mark\n\nIn English Grammar Exclamation mark or point is a type of punctuation mark. It usually shows strong feeling such as anger joy excitement or surprise and so on. Using an exclamation mark in writing English is rather like shouting or raising your voice when speaking English.But using an exclamation mark in writing English has actually changed quite a bit in the last ten years. In this English Grammar lesson you will learn using the Exclamation mark correctly. \n\nThe Traditional rules are :-\n1) An exclamation mark is added when you warn someone\nEg - Be careful! ,Stop! , Don't touch!\n\n2) An exclamation mark is added at the end of an angry statement.\nEg - I disagree with that!\n       Don't you tell me that!\n\n3) When you want to indicate strong command you add an exclamation mark\nEg - Clean that now!\n       Send it now!\n\n4) When using interjections you add an exclamation mark\nEg - \"Ouch! that hurt\"\n       \"Aww! that's sad\"\n\n5) An exclamation mark can be used to close questions that are meant to convey extreme emotions.\nEg - What on earth are you doing!\nEg - Are you serious!\n\nIn the past few years people have started to do a lot more informal writing because of social media. This has changed the way people use the exclamation mark in writing English. It is used to show a friendly note or suggests that the writer is happy,excited or smiling. Some examples of the current usage of exclamation marks are as follows :-\n\nExample - Happy New year to all my friends and family! ( When you wish someone in writing,you add an exclamation mark)\n\nExample - Great Game! We Won! ( Expressing happiness)\n\nExample - You are so adorable! ( Expressing love)\n\nHope this English lesson is helpful to all you learners of English language out there.
