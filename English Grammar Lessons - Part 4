    "description": "Difference between 'See', 'Watch' and 'Look' - English Grammar lesson\n\nTake a test : http://learnex.in/difference-between-see-look-watch/\n\nMany people wrongly use these verbs as they are verbs related to vision. They can't be used interchangeably. Though they are vision related verbs, they have to be used appropriately depending on the situation.\n\n \n\nSee : is a verb of perception. It is an involuntary and an effortless action.  Do not use it in the continuous/progressive form 'seeing'.\n\nExample : I saw Samantha at school yesterday. (casually you noted her presence)\n\nExample : John saw a good film yesterday. (to express that an action is completed, in this case, we are talking about watching the film. 'Watch' can be used in plce of 'see' in this example)\n\nExample : Kelly saw the doctor last eveng. (here, it means she visited the doctor)\n\nExample : I will see the Marketing team tomorrow. (it means you have an appointment)\n\n \n\nLook : is used when you want to give a particular direction to your eyes. When you 'look' at something, it means you concentrate and focus on it. You see something specific at one time. Do not us the verb 'look' in its progressive/continuous form 'looking'.\n\nExample : Look! It's snowing. (so you change the direction of your eys and look towards the window)\n\nExample : Look at th sky.\n\n \n\nWatch : is used when there is a movement involved. You concentrate on something for a long time, like a movie/sport.\n\nExample : I'm watchng an English movie.\n\nExample : Watch the kittens as they may run away.(pay attention to the kittens)",

    "description": "The difference between 'speak' and 'talk'\n\nIn this lesson, we are going to learn the difference between two verbs, 'speak' and 'talk'. People get confused and do not know when to use them and often make mistakes as both the verbs imply verbal communication.\n\nSpeak : is a more formal verb than 'talk'. It is used when one person addresses a group of people,more of a one way conversation, like at a meeting or a conference. A person who is who is fluent and eloquent, is called a good 'speaker' and not a 'talker'.\n\nExample : John will speak at the conference on Monday.\n\nExample : I'd like to speak to the doctor. ( 'speak' is used because the conversation is formal between the patient and doctor)\n\nIt is also used to express expertise in a language.\n\nExample : Henry speaks English and French. (do not use 'talk')\n\n Talk : is an informal verb. It is used when there is a conversation between many people.\n\nExample : My brother and I talked about our future plans. ( 'about' is used to introduce the subject of conversation)\n\nExample : My friends and I talk for long hours daily.\n\nWhen you want to tell someone that their talk makes no sense, you say ;\n\nExample : Don't talk nonsense.(do not use 'speak')\n\nBoth the verbs can be used with the following :\n\nspeak/talk about : to introduce the subject of conversation\n\nspeak/talk to : to introduce the partner or people involved in the conversation.",

    "title": "Difference between ' I Hope ' and ' I Wish ' - English Grammar lesson",
    "description": "Using 'I Hope' and 'I Wish'\n\nThe two expressions 'I hope' and 'I wish' are very commonly used in our daily conversations. There is a slight difference between these two expressions. In this lesson, you will learn how to use these expressions appropriately, depending on the situation.\n\n'I Hope' : is used when there is a good chance of something happening. It is not impossible nor hypothetical. So, there is 'hope' for something that we wish to happen, even though chances may be less.\n\nExample : I hope this is the last mistake. (you say 'hope' because there is a chance of improvement).\nThis is the present tense.\n\nExample : I hope Maria got home safely last night. (generally, we do not use 'hope' to talk about the past, unless you do not what exactly happened, so you just 'hope' she reached safely) \n\nExample : I hope it stops raining. (probably, it's raining now and you hope it would stop after two hours. Even though you hope for a action to take place in the future, do not use 'will'. I hope it will stop raining -- is incorrect)\n\n'I Wish' : is used when we talk about unreal or hypothetical things. There is no possibility of such things happening. So, there is no 'hope', it is just wishful thinking. The verb used in this expression is always in the 'past form'. \n\nExample : I wish you were here with me. (though you wish it in the present, the verb 'were' is in the past form.)\n\nExample : I wish you had told me the truth. (this is a past tense sentence. The time has gone by, you can't go back in time and know the truth. So, to express that you wish something that happened in the past, use the past perfect tense -- 'had told')\n\nExample : I wish he would learn English. (you wish this happens in the future. Use 'would' followed by the verb in its 'present' form to express something that you wish to happen in the future)",

    "description": "The difference between 'Beside' and 'Besides' - English Grammar lesson\n\nThere are a lot of misconceptions regarding the two commonly used words, 'beside' and 'besides'. They can't be used interchangeably. 'Besides' is not the plural of 'beside'.\nBeside : \n\nExample 01 : He has a beautiful beside the beach. (here, beside means next to or close to)\nExample 02 : Richard was beside himself after his father's death. ( 'beside oneself' means 'to be to oneself' due to strong emotions like sadness, happiness.)\n\nExample 03 : That's beside the point. ( this phrase is used when you want something irrelevant or something that doesn't matter is added in a conversation)\n\nBesides :\nExample 01 : What do you do besides teaching? (it means 'in addition to')\n\nExample 02 : He was badly dressed for the interview. Besides, he turned up late. (it means 'furthermore' or an afterthought to what you mentioned earlier. Remember to add a 'comma' after 'besides')\n\nExample 03 : Besides John, everyone liked the idea. (here it means 'except')",

('herself' indicated that she gifted herself and none of her family or friends gifted her)\n\nExample : He cut himself with a sharp knife. \n\n\nIntensive Pronouns : are same as reflexive pronouns but their usage is slightly different. They are used to emphasize.\n\nExample : Peter washed the clothes himself.\n\nExample : Peter washed the clothes.\n\nIn the first example, 'himself' emphasizes that Peter did the work by himself and no one helped him.

    "description": "Learn to speak fluent English -- Accent Training, Correct Grammar usage, Idioms, Phrases and vocabulary with example sentences. \n\nBefore Ceema explains the differences between \"clean up\", \"clean out\", etc. here's a warning: if you don't already know these phrases, it's a bad idea to learn them all at the same time. If you already know these expressions and you'd like to figure out exactly how they're different, Watch on!\n\nSpaces and messes\nWhen you talk about cleaning, you're talking about two different things:\n\nthe space that you're cleaning\nthe mess that's in that space\n\nYou can use each form of \"clean\" to talk about either cleaning the space:\neg. We need to clean up the living room.\nORcleaning the mess that's there:\neg.  We need to clean up those dirty dishes.\n\nThe different forms of 'clean'\nYou \"clean out\" the inside of a space that has a large mess in it:\n\nclean out the refridgerator\nclean out your car\nclean out your desk\nYou \"clean off\" a flat surface:\n\nclean off the counter\nclean off the whiteboard\nclean off your windshield\nYou \"clean up\" a room or a larger area:\n\nclean up your bedroom\nclean up the city\nclean up after the concert\nclean up your hard drive\n\"Clean away\" is different from the others because you only use it to talk about the messy things that you're cleaning, not the space that those things are in:\n\nclean away the dishes\nclean away the mud\nclean away the broken branches\n'Clean' by itself\nWhat about just using the word \"clean\" by itself? \n\nIt usually means to clean the most obvious part of something. For example:\n\nclean the toilet\nThis means to clean the inside of the toilet bowl.\n\nclean the floor\nThis means to clean the surface of the floor.\n\nIf using the word \"clean\" by itself would lead to any confusion, use one of the other phrases instead. For example, instead of saying \"clean the cabinets\", say:\n\nCan you clean out the cabinets?\n\nOr:\n\nCan you clean off the cabinets?",

    "description": "How to use thew verb 'Suggest' correctly? English Grammar Lesson ( ESL) \n\nIt's a common problem that with English learners: a lot of people use the word  \"suggest\" incorrectly. In this video lesson Niharika explains how you should use it.\n\nThe thing to remember is that you suggest an idea, not the person that you're making your suggestion to. In other words, this is incorrect:\n\nI suggest you to apply for a job there. ( wrong)\n\nInstead, say one of these:\nI suggest applying for a job there.\nI suggest that you apply for a job there.\n\nYou may also hear sentences that are similar to the last one, but  without \"that\":\nI suggest you apply for a job there.\n\nIn this sentence, it may seem like you're suggesting a person  instead of an idea. But if you examine it more closely, you're  suggesting the complete idea that \"you apply for a job there\":\n\nI suggest (you apply for a job there).\nOne other thing to remember: don't use \"to\" after suggest: I suggest to apply for a job there.\n\nHere are some other examples which use \"suggest\" correctly:\n\nI would suggest waiting a few more weeks.\nHe suggested I give you a call.\nDidn't you suggest bringing in a consulting firm?\nSo do you suggest that we go forward with the surgery?\nNow that you know how to use \"suggest\", here's a bonus tip: the  word \"recommend\" works exactly the same way!",

So, almost all is about 99%, but not all (100%).\n\nExample : All most all her friends bought Maria gifts for her birthday. (this means around 99% of her friends gifted Maria something, but not all her friends.)\n\nExample : Most of the students of our school dislike Math. (a majority of students).\n\nAlmost : means nearly/ close to. It is not a quantifier. \n\nExample : I almost missed my flight. (this means I just boarded it in time before it was too late. I was close to missing my flight.)\n\nExample : Lisa almost cried when she saw John after many years. (this means she didn't cry. She actually contained herself and was not far from crying. She nearly cried, probably her eyes were cloudy but tears didn't roll down her cheek.)",

    "description": "Commonly confused words - Ago &  Before - English Grammar Lesson http://www.letstalkpodcast.com\n\nMost English learners get confused while using Ago and Before, as they think these words can be used interchangeably unfortunately you can't, they mean different. In this video lesson Rachna brings out the difference between these commonly confused words and explains how to use them correctly.\n\nAGO & BEORE :-\n\nAn expression with ago refers to a finished time, and is normally used with a past tense, not a present perfect tense.However, a present perfect tense is used with since ....ago(as with since+any other time expression)\n\nWe have been in Bangalore since about ten years ago.\n\nAgo is used with a past tense and a time expression to count back from the present; to say how long before the present something happened. Before is used  in the same way(with a past perfect tense) to count back  from a past  moment.\n\nI met that girl in Bangalore three years ago.( not three years before or before three years)\nWhen we got talking, I found out that I had been at school with her husband ten years before.(Not ten years ago.)\n\nWe can also use \"before\" with a present or past perfect tense and no time expression, to mean at any before now/then.\nHave you seen that movie before? Have you been here before \" Yes, I was here a year ago.",

    "description": "How to use articles 'a', 'an', and 'the' in English?  - Basic English Grammar lesson\n\nEnglish articles (\"a\", \"an\", and \"the\") come before nouns. They help to communicate which thing you're talking about, similar to  words like \"this\", \"my\", and \"all\". And they're confusing to a lot of English learners. \n\nArticles are really, really hard! \n\nIf your native language doesn't use articles, they can be really  confusing. The truth is, you might never completely master articles. Most  non-native English speakers don't, even know if they're quite fluent and  have spoken English for a very long time. That's mostly OK. Mistakes with articles don't usually get in the way of communication. Your listeners or readers will usually be able to figure out what you mean by guessing whether you meant  \"a thing\" or \"the thing\". \nSo while you should try to improve your skill with articles, you  shouldn't worry much about them. This video lesson by Niharika will clear your basic doubts for using articles correctly.",

    "description": "What's the difference between \"in time\" and \"on time\"?\n\nThe phrases \"in time\" and \"on time\" are very similar in meaning, but English speakers use them in slightly different situations. In this lesson Niharika brings out the difference between the two time phrases:\n\nOn time :\n\nDoing something \"on time\" means meeting an appointment, or meeting a time that has been set by someone. \n\nFor example: \nI hardly ever get to work on time. \nPeter wants to start the meeting on time.\n\nIn time :  \n\nDoing something \"in time\" means doing it before a deadline, or doing it before it becomes unavailable: \n\nFor Example:\nThe ambulance arrived just in time at the accident spot.\nIf you don't submit your project in time, you will be fired.\n\nIf you make a mistake with choosing \"on time\" or \"in time\", it's not a big problem. Other English speakers might notice your mistake, but they probably won't get upset about it.",

    "description": "Modal verbs - Can and Could - English Grammar lesson : \n\nIn this lesson Rachna explains the difference between 'could' and 'can' when expressing possibility? Most of the time it is clear from the context, but use of can can also express possibility (rather than ability). For example, giving advice answering the question:\n\n How can/could I improve my English?\n You can/could listen to the radio, watch TV and read the newspaper. \nBoth are possible. Students want to know when to use 'could' and when to use 'can'.\n\nSimilarly, How could I improve my English? is more a request for advice, whereas How can I improve my English?is more a factual question about available options. (But of course we can also answer this question by giving advice.)\n\nCan and could, like the other modal verbs, have developed quite a range of meanings and uses. You ask how to explain the difference, and explanation can certainly help, but learning all the ins and outs of these verbs is a long process which requires plenty of experience, observation and experiment. Watch this video lesson to understand when to use Can and Could.\n\nEnjoy!",

One preposition in your native language might have several translations depending on the situation.\n\nThere are hardly any rules as to when to use which preposition. The only way to learn prepositions is looking them up while reading a lot in English and learning useful phrases off by heart . \n\nIn this lesson Rachna brings out some prepositions rules ( in, on, at ) in relation to time.",

    "description": "What's the Difference Between \"A Number Of\" and \"The Number Of\"?\n\nA few weeks ago, Rachna read through a pile of comments debating over the usage of Grammar in the article posted on the blog. \n\nThe sentence posted in the article : \"Over the past few years, there have been a growing number of both peaceful and violent protests.\" \n\nReaders were confused and wanted to know if \"...there have been a growing number of...\" was correct. Shouldn't it be \"...there has been a growing number of...\"?\n\nThis is a question that commonly confuses many ESL students! The problem is that the subject-verb agreement is different for the expressions \"a number of\" and \"the number of.\" \n\nIn this lesson Rachna explains what should be the correct sentence - After watching the video, I hope that clears things up for you! I hope that the number of questions they have about these expressions is now zero.",
