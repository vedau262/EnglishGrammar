    "description": "Using Will I Vs Shall I in future tense questions - English Grammar Lesson\n\nTo take a quiz on this lesson, visit us at : http://www.learnex.in/shall-i-or-will-i-which-one-is-correct-with-future-tense-questions\n\n\n‘Will’ and ‘Shall’ are used in the future tense. But, at times it is confusing when we have to use them to make a question. In this lesson, you will learn when to use ‘shall’ and ‘we’ to make a question.\n\nShall I/We: is used when the person who asks the question is offering to do something.\n\nExample: Shall we wait for you? (we are offering to the action of waiting. If ‘will we’ is used, it would not make sense)\nExample: Shall we invite him to the party?\nExample: Shall I listen to his advice?\nExample: Shall I send you a piece of cake?\nUsing ‘will’ in the above questions would not make complete sense.\n\nWill I/We: is used when you ask general questions, where you are not initiating an action or offering to do something:\n\nExample: Will I get a call from him?\nExample: Will we receive an invitation for the party?\nExample: ill I ever know the truth?\nExample: Will I recover soon from the viral?",

Using the article 'The\" can be quite tricky at times especially for names. When to use it or when not to use it is a common question asked by the English learners. In this lesson we will look at the names without the article 'The'\n\n1. We do not use 'the' with names of people\nExample - Niharika , Helen \n\n2. When we use Mr/Mrs/Captain/doctor etc followed by a name,we do not use 'the'.\nExample - Mr Johnson , Doctor Smith\n\n3. We do not use 'the' with names of places. Some of the examples are given below:\n\nContinents - Africa (not The Africa), Europe, South America\nCountries - Japan , India , Australia\nStates - Texas , Delhi \nIslands - Sicily , Bermuda\nCities - New York , Mumbai, Bangkok\nMountains - We use Mount (Mt) for mountains and lake (lake) without using 'the' \nMt Etna , Mt Everest , lake Superior , Lake Constance",

    "description": "Using Each other and One Another correctly  - English Grammar Lesson\n\nIn this lesson, you are going to learn how to use each other and one another in a sentence. Both are reciprocal pronouns. \n\nEach other: Traditionally speaking, it is used when you talk about two people reciprocating an action or a feeling. But now a days, it could be used to interchangeably with ‘one another’. ‘Each’ and ‘other’ are written separately.  \n\nExample: Rick and Mary don’t like each other. (disliking is mutual)\nExample: We got to know each other quickly.\nExample: They are kind to each other.\nExample: They are kind to each other.\n\nOne another: Generally, it is used to talk about an action that reciprocates between more than two people. ‘One another’ are two separate words. It could be interchanged with ‘each other’.\n\nExample: Everyone in the family gave one another presents.\nExample:  John, Lara and Cindy helped one another.\nExample:  The team members fight with one another.\nExample:  We often stayed in one another’s house.",

    "description": "Adverbs those often cause difficulty -  still, yet, and already. - English Grammar lesson\n\nTake the quiz : http://www.learnex.in/adverbs-those-often-cause-difficulty-still-yet-and-already\n\nThree adverbs that often cause difficulty are still, yet, and already. They are all used when actions are going to happen, or are expected to happen, or were unexpected around the present time. Here we go into more detail about the difference between still, yet and already.\n\nStill\n\nStill - Still is used to talk about an action or situation which continues to the present because it has not finished.It often refers to something happening for a longer period than expected. Still is followed by a verb and sometimes by an adjective and it goes in the middle of a sentence.\n \nExamples - \n \nDo you still live with your parents?\nI'm still upset with your behavior.\nIt is still raining.\nYet\n\nYet - We use yet mostly in questions and negative sentences. Using yet shows that we are expecting something to happen or has happened. Yet comes at the end of a sentence or a question and is used with present perfect.\n \nExamples \n \nHas he finished yet?\nHave they seen the film yet?\nThey haven't paid yet.\n \nOften we use still and yet together in a sentence to explain why an action is being continued.\n \nExamples\n \nI am still going to the college because I haven't passed my last year yet.\nWe still don't  know who will be our new boss. The owners haven't told us yet.\nAlready\n\n \nAlready - We use already to talk about things that have happened often sooner than expected. It goes in the middle or at the end of a sentence just before or after a verb and is commonly used with the present perfect or past perfect. Already is also used to show surprise.\n \nExamples\n \nShe's fixed it already.\nHave you both met already met?\nIt's 12'o clock already?\nI hope this lesson clears your doubts about when and how to use these adverbs.",

Look at these examples:\n\nAt this time last week I was lying on the beach in Goa.\nMy mother was working in the garden so she didn't hear the telephone when I called her yesterday.\nI was watching TV when she called.\nWhat were you doing at 8 o'clock yesterday?\n\nThe past continuous is very often used with the past simple to say that something happened in the middle of something else. In each of the following examples, the single event (past simple) happens in the middle of a longer action (past continuous).\n\nYou phoned while I was having a bath.\nWhen I got home yesterday, a cat was sitting on the roof.\nIt started to rain just as we were getting ready to have our picnic.\nThe boy was standing on the table when the principal came into the room.",

    "description": "Uses of ‘being’ – English Grammar Lesson\n\n‘Being’ is the present participle of the verb ‘be’. It is not used very often. In this lesson, you are going to learn the three basic uses of ‘being’.\n\n1. ‘Being’ is used in the continuous tense to talk about a person’s action or behavior:\nExample: You are being silly.\nExample: He was being naughty.\n\nNote: Do not use ‘being’ to talk about a person’s feeling.\nExample: I am being delighted to meet you. (Incorrect)\nExample: I am delighted to meet you. (Correct)\n\n2. It is used in the present and past continuous passive voice to show continuity of the action in the present or past.\nExample: Dinner is being cooked by mother. (Present continuous passive voice)\nExample: A kite was being made by John. (Past continuous passive voice)\n\n3. It replaces ‘as’, ‘because’ and ‘since’:\nExample: Being late, he couldn't watch the match.

    "description": "Difference between 'So' & 'Neither' - English Grammar lesson\n\nThis lesson is going to teach us the correct usage of very common words like “so” and “neither”.  The first thing to remember is that both these words are used in agreement to a statement that is being said.  However, the difference in the two words is that “so” is used in agreement to a positive statement and “neither” is used in agreement to a negative statement.  Let’s look at the different responses we can get using both these words:\n \n1)When a statement is made in the Simple present tense, you will use\nSo do I-if it is positive statement\nEg:I love shopping\nSo do I\n \nHowever, you will use Neither do I- if it is negative statement\nEg:I don’t like football\nNeither do I\n \n2)When a statement is made in the Simple present using the “be” form of the verb (is, am, are) or if the statement is used in the present continuous tense, you will use\nSo am I- if it is positive statement\nEg-I am a doctor (be form of the verb)\nSo am I\n \nEg:I am studying medicine (present continuous)\nSo am I\n \nHowever, you will use Neither am I- if it is negative statement\nEg:I am not thirsty (be form of the verb)\nNeither am I\nEg:I am not planning to travel (present continuous)\nNeither am I\n \n3) When a statement is made in the Simple past tense, you will use\nSo did I-if it is positive statement\nEg:I read a book last night\nSo did i\n \nHowever, you will use Neither did I- if it is negative statement\nEg:I didn’t go to the party\nNeither did I\n \n4) When a statement is made in the Simple past tense with the be form of the verb (was, were), you will use\nSo was I- if it is positive statement\nEg:I was overweight as a child\nSo was I\n \nHowever, you will use Neither was I- if it is negative statement\nEg:I wasn’t happy with the feedback I received\nNeither was I\n \n5) When a statement is made using words like have or haven’t, you will use\nSo have I-if it is positive statement\nEg:I have registered for guitar class\nSo have I\n \nHowever, you will use Neither have I- if it is negative statement\nEg: I haven’t given her the book\nNeither have I\n \n6) When a statement is made using words like can or can’t, (showing your capability or incapability)you will use\nSo can I-if it is positive statement\nEg:I can read the entire book\nSo can I\n \nHowever, you will use Neither can I- if it is negative statement\nEg:I cant swin for more than 30 minutes\nNeither can I\n \n7) When a statement is made using words like will or wont, (indicating Future tense)you will use\nSo will I- if it is positive statement\nEg:I will cook pasta for lunch tomorrow\nSo will I\nHowever, you will use Neither will I- if it is negative statement\nEg:I wont drive to work tomorrow\nNeither will I",

    "description": "What are Extreme Adjectives? – Free English Grammar Lesson\n\nLink to quiz : http://www.learnex.in/what-are-extreme-adjectives/\n\nAdjectives are words that describe the qualities of something. Some adjectives in English are gradable - that means you can have different degrees or levels of that quality. For example, the weather can be a little cold, rather cold, very cold, or extremely cold.\nExtreme adjectives or non-gradable adjectives are words that mean “extremely + adjective” – for example, “freezing” means “extremely cold.” The weather can’t be “a little bit freezing” or “very freezing” – because the word “freezing” itself automatically means “extremely cold.”\n\nRegular & Extreme Adjectives List \n\nRegular Adjective Extreme Adjective\nangry                     furious\nbad                             awful, terrible, horrible\nbig                             huge, gigantic, giant\nclean                             spotless\ncold                              freezing\ncrowded                      packed\ndirty                              filthy\nfunny                      hilarious\ngood                              wonderful, fantastic, excellent\nhot                               boiling\nhungry                       starving\ninteresting                      fascinating\nold                              ancient\npretty                       gorgeous\nscary                       terrifying\nsmall                          tiny\nsurprising                      astounding\ntired                              exhausted\nugly                              hideous\n\nSpecial Rules for Extreme Adjectives\n\n1) No comparatives/superlatives.\n\nWith regular adjectives, we can use comparatives and superlatives to compare two or more things:\n My house is big.\n My neighbor’s house is bigger than mine.\n(comparative)\n My parents’ house is the biggest house on the street.\n(superlative)\nWith extreme adjectives, we don’t use comparatives and superlatives:\n My parents’ house is enormous.\n My parents’ house is more enormous / the most enormous.\n\n2) Use different adverbs with extreme adjectives.\n\nWith regular adjectives, we can use these adverbs:\n a little, a bit, slightly, fairly, rather\n very, extremely, immensely, intensely, hugely\n\nExamples:\n I’m rather hungry. / I’m very hungry.\n This room is a bit dirty. / This room is extremely dirty.\n We’re a little tired. / We’re immensely tired.\nWith extreme adjectives, we CANNOT use these adverbs:\n I’m rather starving. / I’m extremely starving.\nHowever, there are other adverbs we can use to give additional emphasis to the extreme adjective:\n absolutely\n completely\n utterly\nExamples:\n I’m absolutely furious.\n We’re completely exhausted.\n The movie was utterly terrifying.\nThe words pretty and really can be used with both regular and extreme adjectives:\n This room is pretty dirty. (regular)\n This room is pretty filthy. (extreme)\n The party is really crowded. (regular)\n The party is really packed. (extreme)\n \nAbsolute Adjectives\nAnother type of extreme adjective is called an “absolute” adjective. \nThese are words that are either “yes or no.” For example, dead – you can’t be “a little bit dead” or “very dead” – either YES, you are dead, or NO, you’re not dead.",

    "description": "Using abbreviations i.e., and e.g., correctly in a sentence. -  English Grammar Lesson.\n\nTake the quiz : http://www.learnex.in/using-i-e-e-g-correctly-in-a-sentence\n\nThe abbreviations e.g. (from the Latin exempli gratia) and i.e. (from the Latinid est) are often confused. This is because they are both used to introduce some clarification of something previously mentioned.\n\ne.g.\n\nThe abbreviation e.g. is used to provide an example:\n\nExamples:\n\nThe buffet provided excellent variety, e.g., vegetarian and non-vegetarian soups, Italian and French breads, and numerous sweets.\n(e.g. = for example)\n\nHe was the school champion of many activities (e.g., chess, badminton, 110m hurdles, and high jump).\n(e.g. = for example)\n\ni.e.\n\nThe abbreviation i.e. is used to restate an idea more clearly or offer more information.\n\nExamples:\n\nIt happened in August, i.e., two months ago.\n(i.e. = in other words)\n\nIt happened in August, e.g., two months ago.\n(e.g. = for example)\n\nService charge is included in all prices; i.e., you don't have to leave a tip.\n(i.e. = in other words)\n\nGetting Them Wrong\n\nOften mixing the abbreviations up does not mean your sentence is grammatically incorrect. However, getting them wrong will change the meaning of your sentence.\n\nFor example:\n\nAll amphibians are thriving in the new pond; e.g., the two bullfrogs were being very active yesterday.\n(This sentence is fine grammatically. From it, we infer that there are more amphibians than two bullfrogs in the pond.)\n\nAll amphibians are thriving in the new pond; i.e., the two bullfrogs were being very active yesterday.\n(This sentence is fine grammatically. We infer that the only amphibians in the pond are the two bullfrogs)\n\nCOMMA AFTER E.G. OR I.E.\n\nIn the US, it is usual to follow e.g. or i.e. with a comma. It is less common in the UK. There is leniency in all conventions. The golden rule is: be consistent.\n\nFULL STOPS /PERIODS OR NOT\n\nIt is usual to see full stops (periods) with e.g. and i.e. However, you can write them without. The golden rule is simply: be consistent.",

    "description": "Nouns which are always plural – English Grammar and Spoken English lesson\n\nOf all the grammar concepts we have, “plural” seems to be one of the most uncomplicated. You got one thing? It’s singular. Got more than one thing? It’s plural. But alas, language is always less undemanding than we expect. The way we conceptualize something—as one thing or many things—doesn’t always match up with the way our word for it behaves. There are some nouns that only have a plural form, regardless of how we think of them. In this lesson you will learn Nouns which are always in the plural form.\n\nCertain nouns only have plural forms and are often used with the expression a pair of are as follows:-\na pair of lenses\na pair of jeans\na pair of shoes\na pair of slippers\na pair of glasses\na pair of gloves\na pair of earrings\n\nBelow are some more nouns that are always in the plural form are as follows :-\n• Scissors \n• Clothes\n• Stairs\n• Outskirts\n• Contents\n• Goods\n• Firearms\n• Headquarters\n• Headphones\nSo hope this lesson is helpful to you all out there if you have some more nouns in mind please feel free to share below.",

The use of ‘etc.’ was never taught to us in school, as it was always considered as an abbreviation. In this lesson you will learn the proper usage of the word ‘etc.’\n\n‘etc.’ is used as a short way to say ‘so on’. \n\nFollowing are the tips to use ‘etc.’ correctly:-\n• It is important that the items that we include in a sentence should be of the same kind.  Example: - Bring me soda, alcohol, ice cubes, tonic water etc. for the party tonight.\n• Do not use ‘and’ before ‘etc.’\n• Do not use etc. to refer to people \n• Do not use an introductory phrase for a list ‘such as’ along with etc.\n• Do not use etc. more than once in a sentence.\n• While speaking one can use the words ‘blah blah blah ‘instead of and so o or etc.  but it is not correct to use while writing .\n• While writing one can also use the three dots ‘…’ instead of the word etc.  The three dots are called as ellipses.",

    "description": "What's the difference between There, Their and They're?  - English Grammar Lesson         \n\nA most common mistake what students make is the difference between There, Their and They're in written English. This happens because these words sound the same when they are spoken. These Words  sound the same but have different meanings and spellings. Therefore the words they're, their and there are Homophones.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between There, Their and They're?\n\nTHERE\n\nThere is the opposite of Here. It means “in that place” not here.\n\nA: Where is my book? – B: It’s over there.\nI will look for a hotel to stay when I arrive there.\nThere is/There are = to show that something exists.\nThere is a book on the table\nThere are many countries in Europe.\n\nTHEIR\n\nTheir is a possessive adjective which is used before a noun.

    "description": "Articles - a, an & the  -  English Grammar lesson\n\nTake the quiz - http://www.learnex.in/articles-a-an-the/\n\nThe 3 articles in English are a, an and the. The learner has to decide noun-by-noun which one of the articles to use. \n\nIn fact, there are 4 choices to make, because sometimes no article is necessary. Native-speakers, of course, use the articles correctly without thinking. English learners, on the other hand, need to have some guidelines for making the right choice - particularly those learners whose own language does not have articles.\n\n The guidelines that follow in this lesson should help ESL students to a basic understanding of English article use.\n\nThe words a, an  and the are known as articles.\n• We use an before words that begin with vowels (a,e,i,o,u).\n\nE.g.  I found an orange boat.\n\nHowever there are few exceptions like the words honest and hour. In  the words honest and hour the alphabet h is silent and therefore the letter o becomes the first alphabet of the word and hence we use the article an.\n\nE.g.      Mr. Smith is an honest man.\n            I will be with you in an hour.\n\nWe use a before words that begin with consonants (all the letters of the alphabet except the vowels).\n\nE.g.  Bumble is a baby elephant.\n• We use the before words that we have already spoken about. \nE.g. I bought an apple. The apple is very sweet.",

These words are called interjections An interjection is a word added to a sentence to convey an emotion or a sentiment such as surprise, disgust, joy, excitement, or enthusiasm.

A general exclamation of surprise or frustration or even enthusiasm\nEg- Gee, did you see that crazy biker!\n\n\noops – Something that you didn’t mean to do and therefore you acknowledge your own mistake.\nEg- Oops, I knocked your cup over.\n\nWhoa- Something that is unbelievable so you are surprised and amazed \nEg.

Only use “I” when you are referring to yourself in the subject of the sentence. In other words, you are the one taking action. \nI gave John the book.\nMe is the object – the person who receives the action in the sentence. The pronoun “me” should be used when someone else will perform the action to, or for, you.\nJohn gave me the book.\nOR: John gave the book to me. \nWhen there are more than one subject or object people do get a little confused , so we will see how to use it correctly\n\nJohn and I saw Jane at the party.\nJohn = subject\nI = subject\nJane= object\nThe teacher called Jim and me.\nThe teacher = subject\nJim = object\nme = object\n\nMY and MINE\n\nUse my before the word, and use mine after the word. \nRemember my is always followed by noun where as mine replaces the noun.\nJohn is my friend.\nJohn is a friend of mine.\nThose are my glasses.\nThose glasses are mine.\n\nMYSELF\n\nThe pronoun “myself” should only be used when you are performing the action on yourself. No one else can do anything to yourself.\nThe word myself is used in two cases:\nWhen you do something to yourself \nEg) I accidentally cut myself with the knife.\nFor emphasis - when you want to emphasize the “I”\nEg) I baked this cake myself!\n\nBY MYSELF\n\nThe expression by myself means alone:\nI went out to dinner by myself.",

    "title": "Difference between \"under\", \"below\", \"beneath\", and \"underneath\" - English Grammar Lesson",
    "description": "What's the difference between \"under\", \"below\", \"beneath\", and \"underneath\"? - English Grammar & Vocabulary Lesson\n\nTake the test - http://www.learnex.in/whats-the-difference-between-under-below-beneath-and-underneath\n\nThese words are all similar in meaning, but figuring out the differences between them can be a little tricky. First, it's helpful to know how common each word is:\n\n1. \"Under\" is the most popular.\n\n2. \"Below\" is used about 1/4 as often as \"under\"\n\n3. \"Beneath\" is used 1/2 as often as \"below\"\n\n4. \"Underneath\" is used less than 1/2 as often as \"beneath\"\n\nSo if you're struggling to choose the correct word, \"under\" is probably the safest choice.\n\nNow let's discuss each word in detail.\n\nUnder\n\n\"Under\" is the default choice. In most situations, you can replace any of the other words with \"under\".\n\nCompared to \"below\", \"under\" is more often used to talk about 3-dimensional objects. For example, you'd talk about something being under a table, under a book, etc.\n\n# \"Under\" is also good for talking about layers of something:\n\nI have on a t-shirt under my jacket.\n\n# You can use \"under\" for numbers:\n\nI did it in under 7 hours.\n\nWe were able to raise just under fifteen thousand dollars.\n\n# \"Under\" also shows up in expressions like:\n\nunder stress\n\nunder pressure\n\nunder someone's control\n\nunder someone's influence\n\nunder consideration\n\nunder construction\n\nunder a spell\n\nBelow\n\nCompared to \"under\", you use \"below\" more often to talk about the level of something on a flat plane. For example, if you're describing two photos that hang on a wall, you can say that one of them is \"below\" the other.\n\n# Use \"below\" to talk about the level of something, like a temperature:\n\nIt's supposed to drop below freezing tonight. \n\nIn writing, you can use \"below\" to talk about something later on:\n\nPlease read the instructions below before you begin.\n\nThe opposite of \"below\" is \"above\".\n\n\nBeneath\n\n# \"Beneath\" is more formal than \"under\":\n\nIn the unlikely event of an emergency water landing, you may find a flotation device beneath your seat cushion.\n\nIt can also suggest being covered by something:\n\nbeneath the blankets\n\nbeneath the surface of the water\n\nWhen you're talking about someone's actions or decisions, you use \"beneath\" to talk about the true emotions that a person is hiding:\n\nBeneath it all, he still loves her.\n\nWhen you're talking about human relationships, being \"beneath\" someone is very negative. Things or people that are \"beneath\" you are disgusting. They're too low for someone with your social position:\n\nShe acts like some kind of princess, like we're all beneath her.\n\n\nUnderneath\n\n# \"Underneath\" has a kind of casual and expressive feeling. You can choose \"underneath\" instead of \"under\" to explain the location of something with a little more emphasis.\n\nA: You found it! Where was it?\n\nB: It was underneath the sofa.\n\nThink of \"underneath\" as a more emotional, exciting version of \"under\".",

I should have completed my graduation : ('should' is used when a past duty/obligation not fulfilled. Also, when something was the correct thing to do in the past.)\nYou should have been more careful while travelling. (something that was the right thing to do in the past, but you didn't)\n\n2. I could have completed my graduation : ('could' is used to express a past possibility, or an option you had in the past).\nYou could have helped me yesterday . (you had the option to help, but you chose not to)\n\n3. I would have completed my graduation : ('would' is used to express that you do or don't do something due to circumstances and is used in past conditionals).\n\nIf I had gone to the beach, I would have gotten a tan.

    "description": "Difference Between the prepositions  IN and ON - English Grammar Lesson - http://www.learnex.in/difference-between-the-prepositions-in-and-on\n\nPrepositions are one of the most hated parts of speech. Even experienced writers are sometimes uncomfortable using them. Often people are confused with similar prepositions particularly the prepositions IN and ON.\n\nMore often than not, either IN or ON can be grammatically correct. It entirely depends what you really mean in your statements.\nHere are some few guidelines on how to use these two most commonly misused prepositions:\nIt is advisable to use IN when you are indicating a position for spaces with limitations. IN is used to convey that something is contained or inside. For example,\n\n- The bee is in the beehive.\n- The mail in the mailbox.\n- The file is in the disk.\n\nAlternatively, ON is used to denote a position for surfaces or a position just above or outside an area. Example,\n\n- The book is placed on the table.\n- Charlie sat on the stool.\n- Jane had a tattoo on his arm.\n\nIN is used to denote a moment enclosed in time. It is therefore used with other parts of the day, with months, with years, with seasons. Some examples of these are,\n\n- I like to drink coffee in the morning.\n- AndreaÃ¬s wedding is on October.\n- A lot of terrorist activities happened in 2001.\n- The flowers will bloom in spring.\n\nON is used with days and dates. Also, it may be used in special parts of the day and special holidays. Distinctively, ON is used when you do not enclose something — time included Ã± it is with relative specificity.\n\n- I'll see you on Friday!\n- My retirement is effective on June 23.\n- The event happened on the morning of January 14.\n- We look for colourful eggs on Easter Sunday.\n\nON is used with street names. Conversely, IN is used with names of cities, towns, provinces, states, and countries.\n\n- I'm on Elm street, meet me here Freddie.\n- Jiu-jitsu is big in Brazil.\n- There are so many celebrities in California!\n\nThere are some special considerations of using these two prepositions and it would be best to learn them from experience.\nSummary:\n1. IN is used when you are referring something enclosed by limitations while using IN is relatively specific and does not denote anything enclosed.\n2. IN is used to denote a location of something inside a space while on generally, denotes something above a surface or within proximity.\n3. Whether it is used with place or time, normally, IN is general as compared to the specific implications of ON.",

These three expressions may sound similar but can't be used interchangeably.\n\n1. Still better : is used when something was better before and continues to be better even now. The word 'still' is used to express continuity of something or someone being better over a period of time.\n\nExample : John is not as good as he used to be in playing chess, but still better than William.\nIt is also used to say that something is better even though it has certain bad points.\nExample : The pasta is dry, but it's still better than the one we had at the party last night.\n\n2. Better still : is used when someone makes a good suggestion, but you have an even better one \n\nExample : You can send them your resume or better still, try contacting the manager directly.\n\n3. Better yet : is used to offer a better suggestion to replace a bad idea\nExample : If I am late I will call you and inform, better yet why don't you take responsibility and leave earlier next time.",

    "description": "Confusing verb pairs- 'Borrow' and 'Lend' - English Grammar lesson\n\n\nThe very common verbs lend and borrow are confusing for many learners of English. One reason this happens is because lend and borrow have the same basic meaning, but are used for different \"directions\" in English.\n\nIf John needs something and Mary gives it to John for a limited time expecting that John will return it, Mary lends  to John or Mary lends John  and John borrows  from Mary.\n\nExamples:\n\nMary lent $1500 to John . Mary lent John $1500.\nBill borrowed $150 from Anne.\n\nMichelle often lends his car to Victor.\nMichelle often lends Victor her car.\nVictor often borrows Michelle's car.\n\nMay I borrow your book?\nOf course. I'll be happy to lend it to you. \nOf course. I'll be happy to lend you my book.\n\n\nRemember:\n\nLend shows that something is temporarily given to another person. Borrow shows that something is temporarily taken from another person.\n\nlend - someone\n\nsomeone - borrow",
