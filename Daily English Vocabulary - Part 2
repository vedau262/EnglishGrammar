The act of showing empathy means to empathize and a person who empathizes is known as empathetic.\nFor example, A former smoker is more likely to have empathy with someone who is trying to quit smoking. This is because he underwent a similar phase and exactly knows how it feels.\n\n\nExample 01: To be successful in sales, besides having good selling skills, one should learn how to empathize with their customers.\n\nExample 02 : After John spent several months on researching the prison life, he empathized with the exploited prisoners.\n\nExample 03 : Mary's empathy  for others, has distracted her from solving her own issues at work.\n\nExample 04 : The doctor's empathetic approach towards her patients has made her a favorite amongst them.\n\nExample 05: William empathized with Kelly when she broke down after telling her about  the tragic loss of her family member.\n\nExample 06: Rosy told her friend, \" My empathetic nature towards animals has made me a pure vegetarian.

    "description": "Learn to speak fluent English -- Accent Training, Correct Grammar usage, Idioms, Phrases and vocabulary with example sentences. \n\nDaily Video Vocabulary. Episode 69 : Penny wise and pound foolish\n\nHave you ever gone out of your way to save a few bucks by making a compromise and later land up spending a huge amount due to your foolishness?\nThe idiom 'penny wise and pound foolish' basically means to save a little money, only to\nlose a greater amount due to your own foolishness. A penny is a small amount and a pound is a larger amount, so you are wise with a small amount but foolish and wasteful with larger amounts. It also means you are over careful about unimportant and small matters and careless about important ones. You realize that in the process of being stingy about small expenditures, you eventually spend more than you actually saved.\nFor example, if you save a few hundred bucks by not hiring a tax accountant to review complicated matters, you are penny wise and pound foolish as you ultimately land up paying a huge penalty amount. Okay, now that you know what this idiom means, let's take a look at some example sentences to see how you can use it in your daily conversation.\n\nExample 01: A penny wise and pound foolish Mike bought himself an expensive tuxedo suit even though he didn't need it, but is still thinking whether to buy a much needed pair of shoes. \n\nExample 02: Jennifer was penny wise and pound foolish as she bought cheaper vegetables at a whole sale price, only to be thrown as they were spoilt. \n\nExample 03: The manager realized he was penny wise and pound foolish when he hired undergraduates in order to save the operating cost of the company.\n\nExample 04: Samantha told her friend, \"Neglecting your cavities to save money will certainly lead to a root canal which would be far more expensive, so don't be penny wise and pound foolish\"\n\nExample 05 : Sheela was penny wise and pound foolish when she made her husband drive to six different stores to get the best bargains on her groceries, eventually she spent more on fuel than the benefits she got.\n\nExample 06: Being a handy man, William tried to fix the leaking faucet and broke it, he was penny wise and pound foolish, as he had to replace the faucet, pipe and pay the plumber as well. \n\nExample 07: I sold my good motorcycle and purchased a second-hand car that is giving me endless problems; it was too late to realize that it was a penny-wise and pound foolish decision.\n\nExample 08: The Government's education budget cuts are penny-wise and pound foolish, as public education is an investment towards the nation's future.\n\nExample 09: Mary told her husband, \"We've worked so hard to save money, if we took a vacation now it would be penny wise and pound foolish.",
